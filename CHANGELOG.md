# Changelog

Notable changes to HeryJs. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Because HeryJs generates code once and never re-syncs it, an entry says what
changes for a **new** project. A change to a generated file reaches an existing
project only when its developer applies it by hand, so anything in that
category is called out here explicitly.

## 0.1.0 — unreleased

First public release.

### The CLI

- `hery new` scaffolds a standalone project: the kernel, the CLI, the default
  modules, none of this repository's own demo or documentation.
- `hery create:blueprint` and `hery generate` turn a resource description into
  real NestJS files — a module, a controller, a service, a policy, DTOs — with
  the tenant boundary and the capability checks already wired.
- `hery install`, `hery uninstall`, `hery module:list`, `hery module:new` and
  `hery module:validate` for the module system.
- `hery up`, `hery migrate`, `hery env`, `hery doctor`, `hery console`,
  `hery lint`, `hery hosts`, `hery expose` for day-to-day work.
- `hery mcp:serve` exposes the project's read tools to an MCP client.

### The kernel

- Authentication, API keys and sessions on better-auth.
- Capabilities resolved server-side in memory and returned as decisions
  (`{ allowed, scope }`) — never as rules the frontend could reinterpret.
- Multi-tenancy resolved once per request and enforced underneath permissions,
  with row-level security available per model.
- Teams with the `own` / `team` / `all` / `none` presets.
- An architecture linter that fails CI on a domain missing a concern, plus
  eleven convention checks covering capabilities, pagination, RLS, module
  drift and patched kernel files.

### The modules

`mail`, `storage`, `webhooks`, `live`, `stream`, `impersonation`, `graphql`,
`mcp`, `search-elasticsearch`, `search-meilisearch` and `admin-astro`, each
installable with `hery install` and removable with `hery uninstall`.

A module is its default export, so a third-party package needs no runtime
import from HeryJs: any dependency carrying `heryjs.module: true` is discovered
and installed the same way an official one is.
